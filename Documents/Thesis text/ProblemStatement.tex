\chapter{Problem Statement}
TODO: Explain that this chapter is about defining the problem and what the solving system should be

\section{Use Cases}
TODO: Explain the need for requirements by clarifying examples

This section will examine some hypothetical use cases to serve as a basis for drawing up requirements for the framework. Each case examines a situation where a multi-task pipeline - from the raw datasets to the trained and evaluated models - needs to be created. 

\subsection{Researching Multi-Task Set-ups}

\subsection{Developing General Purpose Classifiers}

\subsection{Testing classifiers}

% Research by comparing different set-ups
% Developing a general purpose classifier that can run on constrained devices and has to be able to do multiple things => lifelogging
% Adding new datasets


\section{Developers}

\subsection{Researchers}
TODO: Who need to vary different parts of the pipeline and report on their effect

\subsection{Optimizers}
TODO: Who need to be able to build and train the best performing model

\section{Design Principles}

TODO: Outline the assumptions you make that the system is built on and the objectives the framework has to achieve to offer better developmental support

\subsection{Fast Prototyping}

Deliver a framework which users can use to quickly build, train and test a deep learning multi-task pipeline without compromise. 

\subsection{Dynamic Handling Of Deviating Cases}

The framework should be capable of handling a wide range of variations in datasets and task structures, without requiring adjustments to be made to the overall structure.

\subsection{Easy Extendibility}

Every part of the pipeline that has variations, should be variable in a modular way.

\subsection{Abstracted File Management}

Functionalities that require a system to write or read files on the system, should be abstracted to the point that users should not be forced to input more than the desired location of the files.

\subsection{Guided Development}

Developers getting familiar with the system should both be in possession of working examples, as well as guiding functions they have to implement in order to build a functioning pipeline.
