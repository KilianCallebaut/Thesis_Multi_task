From my research, I saw the potential of multi-task learning in audio classification tasks. The original focus was on AED tasks, which had been appended with different tasks to varying degrees of success. 

I started off following Georgiev, implementing the feature extraction as a summary of logmel features, with a DNN as a classifier. There was a discrepancy between train and test and bad results on e.g. AED. I reimplemented using a cnn and mel spectrogram features. Now I have to test it all. Testing is going slow. I can't figure out how to use the vm without uploading my data.

I also have to figure out a way to compare the data and get some useful conclusions out of it.
