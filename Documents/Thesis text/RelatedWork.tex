TODO: Explain the field of audio classification, how it normally works, what kind of tasks there are and what kind of things are researched

\section{Multi-task Learning}
TODO: Explain the field of multi-task learning, where it came from, what the paradigm brought in improvements and what kind of things are researched
TODO: Explain multi task learning with unimportant auxiliary task for performance improvement

\section{Multi-task Deep Learning Audio Tasks}
TODO: Explain the merging of these fields and what (little) work has been done there so far. Also what it requires for more work to be done and what the current work lacks.

Audio recognition tasks have only recently seen the adoption of multi-task frameworks, but for a quickly expanding set of reasons. This section maps out the key applications where, why and how deep learning systems where created to address problems. Single task focused systems were the way to go as instinctively it made sense that the best performances would be obtained by focusing on improving solely on building a system addressing that problem. Two factors however changed this notion. For one, systems in real life contexts often have to perform multiple related tasks at once TODO: REFERENCE. For another, sharing information between related tasks have been shown to improve performances as it averages noise patterns and creates a more robust representation of the original data for the final classifier(s) TODO: REFERENCE. Here, it will be demonstrated how these factors influenced the recent evolution towards trying to build systems that optimise for multiple objectives at once. 

TODO: create table of papers

Where it was used:
Multiple tasks that needed to be performed but were done without multi-task

\textbf{Demonstrating Necessities.} What will be done first is demonstrate the context where multiple tasks need to be performed, but were not optimized at the same time in a multi-task setting.
