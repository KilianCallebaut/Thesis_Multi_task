\section{Experiment 4}

% Same or different datasets
	\textbf{Research Question:} What is the effect of the choice of dataset in auxiliary tasks?\\
	
	\textbf{Research Method:} Implement and compare the performance of combining tasks when training on the same dataset as a main task, compared to using a different dataset. \\
	
	\textbf{Possible:} 
		
	\begin{itemize}
		\item AED \& ASC
		\item Speaker Identification \& Keyword detection (Kaggle2018)
		\item AED \& Music/Speech Detection (verify)
		\item AED \& Voice Activity Detection
		\item AED \& Audio Tagging
		\item AED \& Event Activity Detection
		\item (if AED and ASC contain the same classes in the combined subset, then everything above can be combined with ASC as well)
		\item Speaker Identification \& Music/Speech Detection (verify)
		\item Speaker Identification \& Voice Activity Detection (verify)
		\item Speaker Identification \& Emotion Detection (verify)
		\item Speaker Identification \& Gender Detection
		\item Speaker Identification \& Stress Detection (verify)
		\item Keyword Detection \&  Music/Speech Detection (verify)
		\item Keyword Detection \&  Voice Activity Detection
		\item Keyword Detection \&  Emotion Detection (verify)
		\item Keyword Detection \&  Gender Detection
		\item Keyword Detection \&  Event Activity Detection
		\item Keyword Detection \&  Stress Detection (verify)
	\end{itemize}
