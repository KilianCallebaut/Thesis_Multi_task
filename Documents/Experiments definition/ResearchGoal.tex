\chapter{Research Goal}
	In this thesis different combinations of tasks are evaluated in a MTL setup. The example of (2017 Bingel and Sogaard. Identifying beneficial task relations for multi-task learning in deep neural networks) is followed in that this work will try to identify data characterstics and patterns both in single-task and dual-task learning that predict task interactions in MTL deep neural networks.
